* Developed in MacOS *
* Tested with Chrome browser *

Program: a small web application that uses the native capabilities of Node.js and javascript.
         This application allows a user to store and retrieve recipes hosted by the server.
         (Server and Client-side)


Files (in folder a2):

1) app.js (server)
2) public_html folder
      - index.html (html page for the website)
      - 404.html (Error html page displayed when page does not exit)
      - favicon.ico
      - style.css (styling sheet for html elements)
      - recipes folder (contains json files which have recipe information)
3) readMe.txt


Usage:

1) Navigate to proper directory/folder of the a2.js file inside the terminal.
2) type 'node' and enter (make sure node is installed on your computer)
3) type the following, then press enter:

    node app.js

(The console will display a message that the server is running)

4) Go to your browser (preferably Chrome) and type in "http://localhost:2406/"
   into the url bar. Press enter.


Notes:

For some reason, ".DS Store" is an option in the dropdown menu.
This seems to be an issue with the formatting of MacOS files.
